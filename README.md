# Will the Wise Bot - Reddit
In this repository you will find a bot based on the character Will Byers of the series Stranger Things.

## How does it work
Well, you could say he's unemployed right now. I originally made the bot to practice making a reddit bot and because people in the subreddit /r/StrangerThings were talking about how it would be nice to have a Will the Wise bot that said "He's here" or "Want to play D&D?" as he spent most of the third season saying those two phrases. The problem was, mods didn't allow the use of bots in the subreddit, I tried to talk to them but didn't get any response. But hey, at least I got the experience.

## How it was supposed to work
The bot would answer:
* "He's here" if it found the string "Zombie Boy" in a comment. 
* "Want to play D&D?" if it found the string "Will the Wise" in a comment.

Both options only worked in the subreddit mentioned before.
